      <h1>Teacher Appreciation Week</h1>
      <p>
        This year, my daughter's school teacher appreciation week will have a
        Luau theme. I offered to create a image they could use for the week. I
        wanted to incorporate the school's mascot, a bulldog, into the design.
        Even before I started sketching I new I wanted a Tiki Bulldog.
