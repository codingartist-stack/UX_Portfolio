              As a dedicated supporter of the performing arts, I regularly
              attend events, engaging with fellow patrons and snack bar
              volunteers. Recognizing the scarcity of UX designers and
              developers for local community theaters, I aim to show that with
              some attentive care, your website can be elevated and improved.

              The current Cultural Arts Center of the High Desert website has
              visually overpowering elements and an outdated logo, with a
              cluttered navigation bar and action buttons blending into the
              background. My goal is to simplify the design, ensuring a clear
              distinction between the navigation bar, main content area, and
              footer. I aim to streamline navigation, content about events,
              ticket purchasing, and facility booking.

              I initiated the project by creating paper wireframes and sketches
              for a logo redesign. The existing logo lacked inspiration, and
              attempts to retain its elements resulted in an overly intricate
              design. Consequently, I crafted two logos â€“ one for a polished and
              professional appearance, and the other specifically tailored for
              merchandise use.
            </p>

              I dedicated a few weeks to constructing a comprehensive mockup for
              the entire site. Even without images, the mockup exhibited a
              cleaner aesthetic compared to the current site. I enhanced the
              text contrast throughout, maintaining a consistent appearance
              across pages by eliminating background images. While the color
              scheme remains anchored in red, the addition of a gold accent, in
              my opinion, elevated the overall visual appeal.
