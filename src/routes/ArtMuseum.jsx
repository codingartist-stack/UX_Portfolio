          To develop a user-friendly Art Museum website, I conducted research on
          individuals who appreciate visual arts. I hypothesized that users
          exploring an art museum's website or app likely have an interest in
          experiencing the artwork firsthand. However, it became apparent that
          users are more interested in understanding what exhibits to anticipate
          and whether the museum provides opportunities for studying, learning,
          and engaging in art creation.
