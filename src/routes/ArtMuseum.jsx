      <h1>Responsive Art Museum</h1>
      <p>
        To create a responsive Art Museum website I looked into users that enjoy
        looking at art. I made the assumption that if users were looking at an
        art museum&apos;s website or app they would like to see the art in
        person. In reality users would like to know what to expect to see and if
        the Museum offers a place to study, learn, and create art.
